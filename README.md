Green Team Website for CyberForce 2022

This collection of files formed the "Green Team" site used by one of EWU's teams in the DoE's CyberForce 2022 competition. 

It was created to match a given set of screenshots of the site's various pages, utilized Apache for hosting, and a MySQL database for the login functions.

The site was also supposed to provide a live uptime view of other servers on its landing page, but the instructions given for the competition were unclear about what we were allowed to 
touch on said servers (including setting up access for the VM on which this site was hosted), so placeholders are used on the landing page. Otherwise, this site matched the given 
screenshots exactly and netted us most of the points for this category.

I was personally responsible for the creation of the site in its entirety.
